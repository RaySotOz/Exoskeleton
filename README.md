<h1>Upper arm exoskeleton for paraplegic</h1>

<h2>Description of the project</h2>
I did the design of the mechanism to lift a human arm. I used Onshape to develop the CAD of the gearbox for the DC motor used and also did the computations for designing it. The mechanical advantange consist of 4:1. By using two stages and with the high torque DC motor we achieved 50 Nm of torque which was enough for lifting a human arm. The designer then developed all the design of the entire exoskeleton. For the elbow, a hightorque servomotor was enough. I developed all the electronics and the programming with Arduino.
